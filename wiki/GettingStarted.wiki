#summary Getting Started with django-project-management

= Creating a new project =

At the moment projects are created using the admin interface rather than the front-end.

Go to your admin section and click the *Add* link next to *Projects*

===IMPORTANT===
django-project-management was designed to be used in a multi-company, multi-team environment. For this reason if you don't have read access to a project you won't see it in the front end, even if you are the project manager or a Django admin.
